# Project #4

- Play the game https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/project-4-hangman/

## Description

- The game is hangman. click the start button to begin the game. Enter one letter at a time and hit submit! if you guess the letter correclty it will show up on the open spacs above. Guess all the letters to reveal the winning word! You only get 10 wrong guesses!

## Visual Choices

- Most hangman games are played during times of great boredom. Becuase of this I chose the chalkboard design for those times when the teacher left the room.

## Roadmap

- The only thing I want to finish is the ending of the game when the guesses have run out. for this Ill add a modal that will cover the screen letting you know you lost

## Final feelings

- I am happy with the progression of the game, though not fully satisfied. I have a few more things to add that will make me much happier with the project
