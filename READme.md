# HANGMAN

- Play the game https://andrew-frazier6.github.io/project-4-hangman/

## ABOUT

- The game is Hangman and it was built with Javascript, HTML, CSS.


## INSTRUCTIONS

* Click the start button to begin the game.

* Enter one letter at a time and hit submit! 

* If you guess the letter correclty it will show up on the open spaces above.

* Guess all the letters to reveal the winning word! 

* You only get 10 wrong guesses.


## Visual Choices

- Most hangman games are played during times of great boredom. Becuase of this I chose the chalkboard design for those times when the teacher left the room.

## Roadmap

- The only thing I want to finish is the ending of the game when the guesses have run out. for this I'll add a modal that will cover the screen letting you know you lost

## Final feelings

- I am happy with the progression of the game, though not fully satisfied. I have a few more things to add that will make me much happier with the project
